However, after meeting the sixteen-year-old girl&amp;#8217;s parents, it becomes clear they do not like the middle-aged Romeo&amp;#8217;s intentions toward their daughter. Realizing this won&amp;#8217;t be the easy conquest he imagined, Stevie finds solace in his former love interest Jill, who at twenty-one years of age, is too old for Stevie&amp;#8217;s tastes.But Jessie is a stubborn girl. She refuses to allow her father final say where her budding love life is concerned. Cracks begin to appear almost immediately as the relationship begins its ascent. Damaged Girls is a well-written documentation of that which is all too commonplace in our society: One person taking advantage of another for selfish motives. Author Janice G. Ross explores the subject to its very core, bringing to light these character traits that seem to permeate the human race.Ross presents a great study of characters on both sides of this complicated fence, showing that even the victim in this isn&amp;#8217;t really as innocent as one might think. And while the reader certainly won&amp;#8217;t feel sorry for the predatory Stevie, the author manages to paint the man as human rather than monster. He has friends who care about him, particularly the story&amp;#8217;s narrative voice, a woman named Morgan. But friend or not, Morgan&amp;#8217;s goal is to protect the young girl, keeping her from the snare of Stevie&amp;#8217;s web.

I couldn&amp;#8217;t put this book down because I just had to know what happened next. It kept me on the edge of my seat with its action-packed scenes.

She has a witty personality mixed with loads of sarcasm so she&amp;#8217;s pretty perfect in my book. Shaun is freakin&amp;#8217; sex on legs and his mysterious bounty hunter persona only adds to his sexiness. Both characters, actually every character, in this book were well-developed. The plot is well paced and there is never a dull moment. Between the intense drama scenes and the chemistry between Mikayla and Shaun readers are brought into a whirl-wind of a story. Watching the story play out was pretty awesome. I loved watching Mikayla and Shaun work to figure out the mess her mother left. I loved watching the relationship develop between the main characters. Basically, I loved everything about this book.It was calculating, mysterious, and at times down right funny.

Still she believes it will be worth it if she and Sam can be free to live somewhere else without having to look over their shoulders for an assassin sent by the Guild.This is the story of Celaena and Sam, how they love each other, how patient Sam is with her, how she's so afraid to lose control even with him, but she trusts him more than anything in the world. Arobynn tries to undermine Sam's undeniable trust in Celaena by hinting at her past when her parents died, some secret that scares her more than anything, but Sam tells her she'll tell him when she's ready. He actually has more faith in her than she does in herself.Sam wants to do one more job, one big one to get some money so they'll be set when they leave. They won't have to worry about money after this since Celaena paying Arobynn pretty much wiped them out. So, against her gut and wishes, they take the job. And it's their undoing. They are betrayed. It leaves Celaena on her way to the mines and Sam, her beloved Sam who she wanted to spend the rest of her life with, dead. And her brilliant mind way too much time to consider who it was that betrayed them. We as the readers are let in on the secret, but I believe Celaena is thinking along the wrong lines.I can't wait to find out what happens when she finds out who betrayed her! I hope she guts him like a fish! I definitely recommend this story, but think it's better read after Throne of Glass. Celaena comes across as a bit spoiled in this and I think we see the real Celaena in Throne of Glass.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A small town, the town's golden boy, and a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, can only amount to trouble especially when love is involved.Zuri's middle name should have be trouble. From early on, people misunderstood her and judged her by the actions of her stepfather. They thought she was trouble and either kept their distance while whispering bad things about her behind her back or boys only wanted to get in her pants because they thought she was easy. She was a loner, but not by choice. Except there was one cowboy who refused to leave her alone even after she refused him. After finally giving in to his charms, Zuri started realizing that with him is where she belonged, but she was unsure if he felt the same. On a day that should have otherwise been a happy one for a couple of teenagers in love, Zuri finally receives the answer she'd been waiting for. Now it's been twelve years since she last saw Colt Triplehorn, but their reunion may be too little too late.Colt's future changed dramatically the day Zuri walked out of his life. The hopeful young man he was grew up into the hardened sheriff he is now. Although he hasn't seen her in a long time, Zuri still influences his life. From his mood right down to his sex life, or lack thereof, and even his brothers have taken notice. It's Colt's job to maintain order in the small town of Caldera and work the family ranch, but there's something missing in his orderly life. That something appears one-day butt naked and bringing a whirlwind of trouble with her except this time, they are playing by Colt's rules. Too many misunderstandings and hurt feelings still stand in the way, but their physical attraction and chemistry is undeniable. Colt will get his answers and Zuri will get hers, but at what cost when a robbery, a stalker, and mistrust all stand in the way?This first in The TripleHorn Brand series, is fun, fast paced, and full of cowboy goodness! It was great to read the heroine taking the troublemaking lead in the story and give the hero a run for his money in getting her out of it. I figured that with how Zuri grew up she would be a bit harder and much more independent especially when it came to her reunion with Colt, maybe even make him work for it a little more, but that just wasn't the case. They both have things to atone for in their relationship, but Zuri almost immediately hands over control to him and that I just couldn't connect with. The history on their individual backgrounds and relationship is somewhat sparse, but eventually came together by the end. I was looking forward to reading more about Colt's brothers, but not much is given on them, which of course has me searching out the next in the series.Although each of the scenes ended somewhat abruptly, the story kept right on progressing and made it engaging to read. The sex scenes are plentiful and vital to the emotional growth of the couple, but also extremely steamy and well worth the read. I would definitely recommend this to fans of alpha male cowboys with big appetites in and out of the bedroom!Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews</td>\n",

I would love to have something deep and powerful like their love myself. I like to read how Jocelyn deals with challenges coming her way. I find her feelings understandable and close to my own. I'm wondering where her choices would take her, what would I do, what choices would I make if I was in here place and in here circumstances, what would I feel having a chance to see my life from the future. I'm wondering what implications are going to be of her actions. And what so bad could happen? I wonder whether problems would be solved in this book or they would go to the next. And again cover is amazing. I'm excited to see what others would look like.I would say it's emotionally powerful book. There were moments when it made me think about various things in life. It explored feelings of getting in the situation when your life changes a lot. It shows how individuals behave in a sight of challenging life situations, how you can see a person behaving in a way you would not have seen that coming. It tells about the problems we have, how small they are and how big they seem to be. How soon things can get complicated and we can loose the most important things in our lifes. It makes me ask what guides our decisions. It makes me wonder how much of our problems are made up by ourselves and how much is real. And what maybe we create by ourselves these problems.I guess I would feel much the same as past Jocelyn looking to the future and future Jocelyn looking to the past. Living today I don't think about how much times have changed and how much situation has changed for women. I just don't give it a thought, take it for granted and don't consider how I would feel if I couldn't have it all. This story made me think how much life has changed and to cherish things we have. As Jocelyn said &amp;#34;all the stuff that I take for granted everyday and think nothing of&amp;#34;. It brings interest in me to know what social changes have happened, when and why. I know history but not that much how the social life and values have changed, when and why. Also it gives me a thought how much of emotions are behind the facts of history, eg. war, woman freedom. In here there is an opportunity to take a deeper look in differences between two eras and ask myself all these questions.Now as this story has ended I want more and I'm waiting to see what's next.I have received this book free from the David Estes Fans and YA Book Lovers Unite! group and the author in exchange for a honest review.</td>\n",

Why haven't they caught on yet 'to listening' by this age? UGH! LOL!The first time I purchased this item, I had purchased it for the Kindle 3G w/ WiFi Keyboard. I have about 3-1/2 months of this Protection Plan left on it yet.

There is NO GOING BACK TO PURCHASE IT! It is a 'now or never' product to purchase at the time of ANY Kindle product purchase.So I originally purchased this item the first time,- the 2nd Year Extended Warranty, at the time I purchased my first Kindle, as stated above, a little more than 1-1/2 years ago. So far I have NOT needed to use it. I am very careful' when I use my Kindle.This is how 'this' product works: The FIRST YEAR you own your Kindle (of ANY type) it is automatically covered by a 1 year warranty through Kindle. After that 1st year of automatic coverage, there is zero warranty left.Now is when 'this product' kicks in! This 2 Year Protection Plan covers the 2nd Year of owning your Kindle.(Not the 1st year.) This gives you an extended 1 FULL '2nd YEAR' of warranty time.You never know what 'could' happen, so by having this, even if it is only for peace-of-mind, you've got it! I look at it as a kind of insurance for the Kindle. I feel safe and secure knowing I have a second year of warranty time on my Kindle for the first 2 years of my ownership on ANY TYPE OF KINDLE ITEM in case anything happens to it along the way as I use it.I have just purchased the Kindle FIRE HD 8.9&amp;#34;!

This only makes sense, as the more expensive the Kindle, the more expensive the warranty will be. Regardless, the price of this Protection Plan has far exceeded my expectations!Additional thoughts: When we purchase ANY Kindle item, the costs add up for ALL the accessories we purchase for it, and it adds up  quickly! Not only are we purchasing the Kindle item, but ALL the other accessories that go with it, so if ANYTHING happens to your Kindle, you WANT IT REPLACED! This allows you to do so! So, to have this 2nd year Protection Plan is well-worth EVERY PENNY! It's a must-NEED item to go along with your Kindle!

I read the synopsis and I thought to myself, &amp;#8220;This sounds good,&amp;#8221; but I didn't realise just how great it was until chapter 4. Chapters 1 to 3 were good BUT, from chapter 4, I was well and truly hooked.I loved Lexi from the beginning, probably because she was the woman I wish I was when I was younger, but as I got to &amp;#8216;know&amp;#8217; her more and realised that she had so many layers, I LOVED her. Because I didn't read &amp;#8220;About the Author&amp;#8221; until after I had finished the book, I wasn't aware that her goal was to write a book with a strong female character. Well, I definitely think she achieved that goal.Although this was Lexi&amp;#8217;s story, I also loved all the other characters (except Marcy). They all had an integral part to play in the book and not one character was superfluous. How could I not love Alex? I was pleased when I found out that the person I pictured for Alex was also the author&amp;#8217;s muse, but that&amp;#8217;s probably because the author&amp;#8217;s portrayal of characters and her writing were so good.But Alex wasn't the only other character that I fell in love with. There was Matt and James and Kate and Hannah and Mike. Yes, there were more, but the best thing was how each character played an important part in Lexi&amp;#8217;s life and each other&amp;#8217;s.Even though I've mentioned the characters a lot, they were not the only strength of this book. I've already mentioned the connections between the characters, but the events were also connected and the whole story flowed seamlessly. I even found the chapter headings to be entertaining.When I said that I didn't realise how great it was until chapter 4, I forgot to say that it kept getting better and better from that point on. At no time, did I feel that the story was stagnating and not moving on. Like its characters, every event that occurred had a place in the story.  I'm also very happy that I can start reading the next one &amp;#8220;A Leap of Faith&amp;#8221; straight away because I don&amp;#8217;t want to wait.

Because I didn't read &amp;#8220;About the Author&amp;#8221; until after I had finished the book, I wasn't aware that her goal was to write a book with a strong female character. Well, I definitely think she achieved that goal.Although this was Lexi&amp;#8217;s story, I also loved all the other characters (except Marcy). They all had an integral part to play in the book and not one character was superfluous. How could I not love Alex? I was pleased when I found out that the person I pictured for Alex was also the author&amp;#8217;s muse, but that&amp;#8217;s probably because the author&amp;#8217;s portrayal of characters and her writing were so good.But Alex wasn't the only other character that I fell in love with. There was Matt and James and Kate and Hannah and Mike. Yes, there were more, but the best thing was how each character played an important part in Lexi&amp;#8217;s life and each other&amp;#8217;s.Even though I've mentioned the characters a lot, they were not the only strength of this book. I've already mentioned the connections between the characters, but the events were also connected and the whole story flowed seamlessly. I even found the chapter headings to be entertaining.When I said that I didn't realise how great it was until chapter 4, I forgot to say that it kept getting better and better from that point on. At no time, did I feel that the story was stagnating and not moving on. Like its characters, every event that occurred had a place in the story.  I'm also very happy that I can start reading the next one &amp;#8220;A Leap of Faith&amp;#8221; straight away because I don&amp;#8217;t want to wait. BTW, A Twist of Fate doesn't end with a cliff hanger.This was a book I could NOT put down willingly. I gave A Twist of Fate 5 out of 5 stars.Written by Karen from Confessions of a Bookaholic</td>\n",

But this is from another author recommendation and I do find that its well written for a sort-of trashy romance novel. The novel began much like any ordinary Harlequin-setting island paradise with a female character and her obnoxious friend and suddenly there's a big hurricane incoming towards them and the main character inexplicably trapped in the hotel's elevator with a guy and they're stranded on the island for several days and spent being together and romancing until they're saved and she realized that the guy who saved her life is a billionaire - and she ran away.You read that right. That is the start of a good relationship I had with this series. Bronte is an entertaining character to read about. Weirdly funny, spunky, stubborn, smart, don't take any nonsense and very independant and very flawed and prideful, random and frankly quotable. She's a waitress having a hard time finding a permanent job even when she had a degree (some predicament I could relate to) and have a hive mind with greek philosopher and quotes random dead author's phrases that baffled and entice Logan. But one of the things she have a hard time accepting, people who lied to her. That's what essentially Logan did to her when he omitted out that he own the island wreckage  and also several jet planes which made the book entirely unpredictable and interesting to say the least. He end up buying the diner where she work just to ask her to spend the time with him in New York. Thats the fantasy everyone love right? But then Bronte became increasingly annoyed with Logan and the way everyone treated her as if she's replaceable and she hated it when Logan shower her gifts and then she literally blew up. Yep, loads of groveling in coming.As a contemporary romance, Bronte is a very likable character. Logan aren't that bad himself but he does seem like an average guy underneath his bluster. The book started like an average pulp but then end up being very enjoyable to the end.</td>\n",

They are not the only thing wrong with this novel.  I should have been suspicious of all the one line five star reviews with nothing substantive to say.Harry and Natasha are supposedly the best, most sought after detectives in this whole Jamaican police department department because they get results.  I hate to think of the worst because these two are dumb as posts.  They are sent undercover to investigate a murder of the president of a Christian college.Two of the first characters to be introduced are Taj Jackson, recruited for a new psychiatric dept. as well as potentially new president.  Another is Anne Carter, who Natasha knows from her church at home.  Taj knows he is adopted.  At least 6 people remark about his uncanny resemblance to the acting president, Ryan Bancroft.  Anne has remarkably curly hair, which is exactly like Taj's.  Natasha knows that Anne grew up in a poor family with many children whose fisherman father was lost at sea.  Then, when investigating the details of Taj's adoption, it is discovered that he was given up by a young pregnant girl with extremely curly hair who came from a family with many children; and yes, her fisherman father was lost at sea.  And yes, they discover that the Bancroft family used to live there as well, approximately the time when Taj was born.  At one point, the author writes: Harry rubbed his ears.  He always did that when he was close to some important piece of information and could not figure it out.  At about sixty percent through the book I literally laughed out loud when I read ...Natasha said, \"I'm missing something.  Something vital.\"  No kidding, Sherlock, the rest of us have it in the bag!Besides the grammar and spelling issues, there is the stupid and awkward writing:  For years he worked on his accent so that it didn't have a trace of idiomatic slant clouding his otherwise smooth speech.  Or: Taj looked at her big limped brown eyes and realized something.  She was using her sex appeal on him.  And then: \"Taj, huh?\" Harry looked at her funnily.  \"You said that too feelingly.\"  How about redundancy:  Natasha stared at Taj, taking in his curly ruffled hair that looked as if it had been ruffled... Yep, it was ruffled.  Or:  Now what was her story?  Everybody had a story and amount of relationship baggage.  She looked to be in her early twenties--no ring on her finger--very attractive.  Usually these days that meant a whole lot of baggage.  He usually stayed away from 'baggage.\"  Then there were just those WTF does she mean phrases:  The class was very near his office and he felt a twinge of regret that he had not made the effort to reach there on time.  He liked to start as he meant to go on and he did not want to have a reputation as the professor who was never on time.  Or Taj paused for awhile before he walked up to the impressive walkway.  On each stairwell was a representative of each of the four animals from Daniels vision in the Bible.  So, to be clear, the animals sent representatives?  And does the author know that a stairwell is an empty space for steps ...I'm having trouble picturing this...  Natasha ceased her sympathy like a lifeline and offered some of her own.  What?!  \"I don't mean to cut you, Mrs. Carlisle,\" Harry said butting in.  Wow! don't interrupt him when he has a knife!  My favorite:  \"Because I had five miscarriages and the doctor had to remove my womb from the last baby.\"  Baby hung on tight, I guess...This was sappy romance and ridiculous mystery.  The only ones not getting it were the detectives.  I'm a nurse, so I found the the whole potassium poison theory a farce.  Hyperkalemia is too much potassium and it's definitely not treated by giving someone more ( that would be hypokalemia.)  The  author has a doctor saying ...leads to a type of cardiac arrest known as ventricular fibrillation, just one of many types of cardiac arrest.  No, arrest means stop.  There is only one kind of cardiac arrest, in which the heart stops beating.  Ventricular fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia, or aberrant heartbeat...or, never mind.  The man who was stuck from behind and collapsed, rendering him conveniently unable to identify his attacker?  It would have to be injected directly into a vein and even then wouldn't be that immediate.  And the pathologist who was suspicious of the dead man's K levels did not look for an injection site?  Unbelievable!  But conjecture didn't stop Harry from announcing a least six times \"he did it!\" Or \"she did it.\" about all of the suspects in succession -- except the real killer.

It held my interest up until about 70% of the book. I'll start with what I liked about the book. Nora has always done what her father wanted her to do. She broke off her relationship with the first man she had ever loved because her father didn't approve of him. She later meets Liam, a man who works for her father. They soon become engaged and he starts to show his true colors. Finally standing up for herself, she leaves Liam the day before their wedding. This was the first step she took in finding her independence. I thought for sure that she would stay with him to make her father happy.Next, she decides to get away from town and go to Dreara. Some time away can give her time to think about what she really wants. She makes some new friendships and even meets a new guy named Ethan. They have both been scarred by love and aren't ready to take their friendship to the next level....yet. Ethan encourages Nora to go to cooking school. One of Nora's lifelong dreams was to learn to cook and open her own restaurant. Nora shows such tremendous growth throughout the story. I will tell you that she does eventually start a relationship with Ethan, but I will leave it at that.Now for my gripes...I can't tell you much without spoiling the story. I feel that there were too many conflicts towards the end. I understand why they were there. They were beneficial in turning the story around. I was glad that she worked things out with her father but I feel like she turned into an indecisive teenager at the end. It was a lot of back and forth and it really turned me off. I seriously wanted to throw something. The romance was a bit tame and I would have liked more of the swoon factor.</td>\n",

He's a librarian, for goodness sake, not a porn star or a strapping serial killer who spent his life chained in a basement. He's a guy who survived a hellacious childhood at the hands of his schizophrenic father. But he has survived and made himself a happy little life.And then someone starts harassing Joshua, hurting those around him. And Joshua keeps waking up naked, bloody and with no memory of the past few hours. A trip to the psychiatrist seems to help, until Joshua's nemesis crawls out of his own head and turns Joshua's life upside down. Josh has another personality living inside of him, a personality that, if the shrink is allowed to \"cure\" Josh, will die. So it's a life and death battle and we just gotta wonder - is mild-mannered Josh able to defeat the damaged, amoral Corn Bred? Josh's own mind created Corn Bred to protect Josh from memories of his childhood terrors, but now it's a clash of wills as the two personalities fight for control of Josh's body and his life.Dont' wait for Pudge's usual belly-laughs and crazy asides.

       "376716  Stevie is a man in his mid-thirties. His one obvious vice in life is a taste for young, barely legal girls. The way Stevie sees it, if a girl reaches the age of consent&#8212;age 16 in his neck of the woods&#8212;she&#8217;s fair game.When Stevie meets the young Jessie, he begins to plot and scheme to make the girl his own. However, after meeting the sixteen-year-old girl&#8217;s parents, it becomes clear they do not like the middle-aged Romeo&#8217;s intentions toward their daughter. Realizing this won&#8217;t be the easy conquest he imagined, Stevie finds solace in his former love interest Jill, who at twenty-one years of age, is too old for Stevie&#8217;s tastes.But Jessie is a stubborn girl. She refuses to allow her father final say where her budding love life is concerned. Cracks begin to appear almost immediately as the relationship begins its ascent. Damaged Girls is a well-written documentation of that which is all too commonplace in our society: One person taking advantage of another for selfish motives. Author Janice G. Ross explores the subject to its very core, bringing to light these character traits that seem to permeate the human race.Ross presents a great study of characters on both sides of this complicated fence, showing that even the victim in this isn&#8217;t really as innocent as one might think. And while the reader certainly won&#8217;t feel sorry for the predatory Stevie, the author manages to paint the man as human rather than monster. He has friends who care about him, particularly the story&#8217;s narrative voice, a woman named Morgan. But friend or not, Morgan&#8217;s goal is to protect the young girl, keeping her from the snare of Stevie&#8217;s web. But Morgan just might be too late.Damaged Girls by Janice Ross is a good, solid read; dark at ties, but quite the page-turner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "926590  I fell in love with Jus when I devoured RUINED and let me tell you&#8230;I fell in love all over again with RULES OF SURVIVAL. She has a way of enthralling readers. She keeps them captivated with her story lines and riveting characters.RULES OF SURVIVAL was full of drama and mystery. I couldn&#8217;t put this book down because I just had to know what happened next. It kept me on the edge of my seat with its action-packed scenes. It seemed like when Mikayla and Shaun found one piece to the ever growing puzzle it brought up more and more questions surrounding Mikayla&#8217;s, um, predicament. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything for ya&#8217;ll, but wow&#8230;Mikayla has been through the ringer and her world has been one big pot of craziness since her mother&#8217;r murder. Shaun has his own set of demons so together they are hilariously perfect for one another even if they are on different sides of this cat-mouse game.Mikayla&#8217;s character was likable. She has a witty personality mixed with loads of sarcasm so she&#8217;s pretty perfect in my book. Shaun is freakin&#8217; sex on legs and his mysterious bounty hunter persona only adds to his sexiness. Both characters, actually every character, in this book were well-developed. The plot is well paced and there is never a dull moment. Between the intense drama scenes and the chemistry between Mikayla and Shaun readers are brought into a whirl-wind of a story. Watching the story play out was pretty awesome. I loved watching Mikayla and Shaun work to figure out the mess her mother left. I loved watching the relationship develop between the main characters. Basically, I loved everything about this book.It was calculating, mysterious, and at times down right funny. Jus Accardo&#8217;s writing style is very unique and so far I have loved everything I have read by her. I look forward to many more amazing stories by Jus Accardo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Each has a link to the missing children and some links are more sinister than others.Very Intriguing Novel!**Review copy courtesy of Original Publisher CHBB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "256627  ***Contains spoilers if you have not read Throne of Glass*****This occurs right before Celaena is captured and sent to the mines.Celaena and Sam want to escape the city and leave the Guild of Assassins with the blessing of Arobynn. But the price Arobynn wants for them will almost clean Celaena out and he knows it. Still she believes it will be worth it if she and Sam can be free to live somewhere else without having to look over their shoulders for an assassin sent by the Guild.This is the story of Celaena and Sam, how they love each other, how patient Sam is with her, how she's so afraid to lose control even with him, but she trusts him more than anything in the world. Arobynn tries to undermine Sam's undeniable trust in Celaena by hinting at her past when her parents died, some secret that scares her more than anything, but Sam tells her she'll tell him when she's ready. He actually has more faith in her than she does in herself.Sam wants to do one more job, one big one to get some money so they'll be set when they leave. They won't have to worry about money after this since Celaena paying Arobynn pretty much wiped them out. So, against her gut and wishes, they take the job. And it's their undoing. They are betrayed. It leaves Celaena on her way to the mines and Sam, her beloved Sam who she wanted to spend the rest of her life with, dead. And her brilliant mind way too much time to consider who it was that betrayed them. We as the readers are let in on the secret, but I believe Celaena is thinking along the wrong lines.I can't wait to find out what happens when she finds out who betrayed her! I hope she guts him like a fish! I definitely recommend this story, but think it's better read after Throne of Glass. Celaena comes across as a bit spoiled in this and I think we see the real Celaena in Throne of Glass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "285535  A small town, the town's golden boy, and a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, can only amount to trouble especially when love is involved.Zuri's middle name should have be trouble. From early on, people misunderstood her and judged her by the actions of her stepfather. They thought she was trouble and either kept their distance while whispering bad things about her behind her back or boys only wanted to get in her pants because they thought she was easy. She was a loner, but not by choice. Except there was one cowboy who refused to leave her alone even after she refused him. After finally giving in to his charms, Zuri started realizing that with him is where she belonged, but she was unsure if he felt the same. On a day that should have otherwise been a happy one for a couple of teenagers in love, Zuri finally receives the answer she'd been waiting for. Now it's been twelve years since she last saw Colt Triplehorn, but their reunion may be too little too late.Colt's future changed dramatically the day Zuri walked out of his life. The hopeful young man he was grew up into the hardened sheriff he is now. Although he hasn't seen her in a long time, Zuri still influences his life. From his mood right down to his sex life, or lack thereof, and even his brothers have taken notice. It's Colt's job to maintain order in the small town of Caldera and work the family ranch, but there's something missing in his orderly life. That something appears one-day butt naked and bringing a whirlwind of trouble with her except this time, they are playing by Colt's rules. Too many misunderstandings and hurt feelings still stand in the way, but their physical attraction and chemistry is undeniable. Colt will get his answers and Zuri will get hers, but at what cost when a robbery, a stalker, and mistrust all stand in the way?This first in The TripleHorn Brand series, is fun, fast paced, and full of cowboy goodness! It was great to read the heroine taking the troublemaking lead in the story and give the hero a run for his money in getting her out of it. I figured that with how Zuri grew up she would be a bit harder and much more independent especially when it came to her reunion with Colt, maybe even make him work for it a little more, but that just wasn't the case. They both have things to atone for in their relationship, but Zuri almost immediately hands over control to him and that I just couldn't connect with. The history on their individual backgrounds and relationship is somewhat sparse, but eventually came together by the end. I was looking forward to reading more about Colt's brothers, but not much is given on them, which of course has me searching out the next in the series.Although each of the scenes ended somewhat abruptly, the story kept right on progressing and made it engaging to read. The sex scenes are plentiful and vital to the emotional growth of the couple, but also extremely steamy and well worth the read. I would definitely recommend this to fans of alpha male cowboys with big appetites in and out of the bedroom!Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "23539   Mindy McLaurin is in jail on embezzlement charges.  Coming from her background, she is totally out of her element.  She claims her innocence as do most inmates, but the only one to believe her is Counselor Stone.Prior to Mindy's incarceration, Alexis died suspiciously while in jail.  Her mother, Gwen, is having her death investigated.  While in jail, Mindy's  `cellie' is murdered.  Mindy has her suspicions, but can't prove anything.The inmate protagonists, especially Red, Deputy Delacy and Major, make for a real-to-life prison setting.  Having read books on real jailhouse environments, K. Dawn Byrd, in Killing Time,  has set the stage for some very real, intriguing, and unsettling times for Mindy.  You are kept `on edge,' rooting for her safety throughout her incarceration.Once she is bailed out, you think everything will be settled in due time.  That's when K. Dawn Byrd ups the ante on the suspense.  If Mindy thought life was hard in jail, it becomes a nightmare out of jail.  The plots and twists are even more eerie and threatening.I loved the romance that built up from the first interaction between Mindy and Counselor Stone.  It was a sweet, yet believable, relationship that developed over time.  But would it last?  Mindy was having difficulties about whom she could trust?To punctuate the story with delight, Zippy, Mindy's Chinese Crested dog was introduced.  I think he added to the story as much as the characters!  What energy and spice!  Makes me want one!The title of the book has a double connotation to it-Killing Time.  A very creative title for a very creative story!  Although this is my first book by K. Dawn Byrd, it won't be my last!  A definite 4.5 out of 5.0!This e-book was provided by K.

       "874920  I'm excited to start book two, to know what's next and what would Jocelyn do. I love to read about Jocelyn and Jackson, about their friends and family. They have become dear to me. I would love to have something deep and powerful like their love myself. I like to read how Jocelyn deals with challenges coming her way. I find her feelings understandable and close to my own. I'm wondering where her choices would take her, what would I do, what choices would I make if I was in here place and in here circumstances, what would I feel having a chance to see my life from the future. I'm wondering what implications are going to be of her actions. And what so bad could happen? I wonder whether problems would be solved in this book or they would go to the next. And again cover is amazing. I'm excited to see what others would look like.I would say it's emotionally powerful book. There were moments when it made me think about various things in life. It explored feelings of getting in the situation when your life changes a lot. It shows how individuals behave in a sight of challenging life situations, how you can see a person behaving in a way you would not have seen that coming. It tells about the problems we have, how small they are and how big they seem to be. How soon things can get complicated and we can loose the most important things in our lifes. It makes me ask what guides our decisions. It makes me wonder how much of our problems are made up by ourselves and how much is real. And what maybe we create by ourselves these problems.I guess I would feel much the same as past Jocelyn looking to the future and future Jocelyn looking to the past. Living today I don't think about how much times have changed and how much situation has changed for women. I just don't give it a thought, take it for granted and don't consider how I would feel if I couldn't have it all. This story made me think how much life has changed and to cherish things we have. As Jocelyn said &#34;all the stuff that I take for granted everyday and think nothing of&#34;. It brings interest in me to know what social changes have happened, when and why. I know history but not that much how the social life and values have changed, when and why. Also it gives me a thought how much of emotions are behind the facts of history, eg. war, woman freedom. In here there is an opportunity to take a deeper look in differences between two eras and ask myself all these questions.Now as this story has ended I want more and I'm waiting to see what's next.I have received this book free from the David Estes Fans and YA Book Lovers Unite! group and the author in exchange for a honest review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Why haven't they caught on yet 'to listening' by this age? UGH! LOL!The first time I purchased this item, I had purchased it for the Kindle 3G w/ WiFi Keyboard. I have about 3-1/2 months of this Protection Plan left on it yet. I have NOT had to use this so far, but I have the 'peace of mind', knowing if I 'do' need to use it, it IS THERE!This is how it works: You 'MUST' buy it when you purchase the Kindle item of your choice. There is NO GOING BACK TO PURCHASE IT! It is a 'now or never' product to purchase at the time of ANY Kindle product purchase.So I originally purchased this item the first time,- the 2nd Year Extended Warranty, at the time I purchased my first Kindle, as stated above, a little more than 1-1/2 years ago. So far I have NOT needed to use it. I am very careful' when I use my Kindle.This is how 'this' product works: The FIRST YEAR you own your Kindle (of ANY type) it is automatically covered by a 1 year warranty through Kindle. After that 1st year of automatic coverage, there is zero warranty left.Now is when 'this product' kicks in! This 2 Year Protection Plan covers the 2nd Year of owning your Kindle.(Not the 1st year.) This gives you an extended 1 FULL '2nd YEAR' of warranty time.You never know what 'could' happen, so by having this, even if it is only for peace-of-mind, you've got it! I look at it as a kind of insurance for the Kindle. I feel safe and secure knowing I have a second year of warranty time on my Kindle for the first 2 years of my ownership on ANY TYPE OF KINDLE ITEM in case anything happens to it along the way as I use it.I have just purchased the Kindle FIRE HD 8.9&#34;! I can't WAIT to get it!Yes, I purchased THIS PRODUCT WHEN I PURCHASED THE FIRE! Remember - this product MUST BE PURCHASED WHEN YOU PURCHASE 'ANY' KINDLE PRODUCT 'at the same time you purchase your Kindle (of any type)!' PLEASE remember this!You should be VERY happy with it!'The prices 'do' vary, depending on the type of Kindle item you purchase. This only makes sense, as the more expensive the Kindle, the more expensive the warranty will be. Regardless, the price of this Protection Plan has far exceeded my expectations!Additional thoughts: When we purchase ANY Kindle item, the costs add up for ALL the accessories we purchase for it, and it adds up  quickly! Not only are we purchasing the Kindle item, but ALL the other accessories that go with it, so if ANYTHING happens to your Kindle, you WANT IT REPLACED! This allows you to do so! So, to have this 2nd year Protection Plan is well-worth EVERY PENNY! It's a must-NEED item to go along with your Kindle! No matter what Kindle item it is, you are protecting!Thankfully, I have NOT had to use this so far, but still have about 3 months left on it. Hopefully I won't have to use it, but I feel safe and secure just knowing I DO have it for that 'just in case'!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "629288  I didn't read this book until it was recommended to me by a friend who said she couldn't put it down. I read the synopsis and I thought to myself, &#8220;This sounds good,&#8221; but I didn't realise just how great it was until chapter 4. Chapters 1 to 3 were good BUT, from chapter 4, I was well and truly hooked.I loved Lexi from the beginning, probably because she was the woman I wish I was when I was younger, but as I got to &#8216;know&#8217; her more and realised that she had so many layers, I LOVED her. Because I didn't read &#8220;About the Author&#8221; until after I had finished the book, I wasn't aware that her goal was to write a book with a strong female character. Well, I definitely think she achieved that goal.Although this was Lexi&#8217;s story, I also loved all the other characters (except Marcy). They all had an integral part to play in the book and not one character was superfluous. How could I not love Alex? I was pleased when I found out that the person I pictured for Alex was also the author&#8217;s muse, but that&#8217;s probably because the author&#8217;s portrayal of characters and her writing were so good.But Alex wasn't the only other character that I fell in love with. There was Matt and James and Kate and Hannah and Mike. Yes, there were more, but the best thing was how each character played an important part in Lexi&#8217;s life and each other&#8217;s.Even though I've mentioned the characters a lot, they were not the only strength of this book. I've already mentioned the connections between the characters, but the events were also connected and the whole story flowed seamlessly. I even found the chapter headings to be entertaining.When I said that I didn't realise how great it was until chapter 4, I forgot to say that it kept getting better and better from that point on. At no time, did I feel that the story was stagnating and not moving on. Like its characters, every event that occurred had a place in the story.  I'm also very happy that I can start reading the next one &#8220;A Leap of Faith&#8221; straight away because I don&#8217;t want to wait. BTW, A Twist of Fate doesn't end with a cliff hanger.This was a book I could NOT put down willingly. I gave A Twist of Fate 5 out of 5 stars.Written by Karen from Confessions of a Bookaholic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "318189  I don't make it a secret that I do read these type of books out of boredom. But this is from another author recommendation and I do find that its well written for a sort-of trashy romance novel. The novel began much like any ordinary Harlequin-setting island paradise with a female character and her obnoxious friend and suddenly there's a big hurricane incoming towards them and the main character inexplicably trapped in the hotel's elevator with a guy and they're stranded on the island for several days and spent being together and romancing until they're saved and she realized that the guy who saved her life is a billionaire - and she ran away.You read that right. That is the start of a good relationship I had with this series. Bronte is an entertaining character to read about. Weirdly funny, spunky, stubborn, smart, don't take any nonsense and very independant and very flawed and prideful, random and frankly quotable. She's a waitress having a hard time finding a permanent job even when she had a degree (some predicament I could relate to) and have a hive mind with greek philosopher and quotes random dead author's phrases that baffled and entice Logan. But one of the things she have a hard time accepting, people who lied to her. That's what essentially Logan did to her when he omitted out that he own the island wreckage  and also several jet planes which made the book entirely unpredictable and interesting to say the least. He end up buying the diner where she work just to ask her to spend the time with him in New York. Thats the fantasy everyone love right? But then Bronte became increasingly annoyed with Logan and the way everyone treated her as if she's replaceable and she hated it when Logan shower her gifts and then she literally blew up. Yep, loads of groveling in coming.As a contemporary romance, Bronte is a very likable character. Logan aren't that bad himself but he does seem like an average guy underneath his bluster. The book started like an average pulp but then end up being very enjoyable to the end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "560971  ..except this is not supposed to be a comedy?  I won't even mention all the editing issues, as they have been well outlined by other reviewers.  They are not the only thing wrong with this novel.  I should have been suspicious of all the one line five star reviews with nothing substantive to say.Harry and Natasha are supposedly the best, most sought after detectives in this whole Jamaican police department department because they get results.  I hate to think of the worst because these two are dumb as posts.  They are sent undercover to investigate a murder of the president of a Christian college.Two of the first characters to be introduced are Taj Jackson, recruited for a new psychiatric dept. as well as potentially new president.  Another is Anne Carter, who Natasha knows from her church at home.  Taj knows he is adopted.  At least 6 people remark about his uncanny resemblance to the acting president, Ryan Bancroft.  Anne has remarkably curly hair, which is exactly like Taj's.  Natasha knows that Anne grew up in a poor family with many children whose fisherman father was lost at sea.  Then, when investigating the details of Taj's adoption, it is discovered that he was given up by a young pregnant girl with extremely curly hair who came from a family with many children; and yes, her fisherman father was lost at sea.  And yes, they discover that the Bancroft family used to live there as well, approximately the time when Taj was born.  At one point, the author writes: Harry rubbed his ears.  He always did that when he was close to some important piece of information and could not figure it out.  At about sixty percent through the book I literally laughed out loud when I read ...Natasha said, \"I'm missing something.  Something vital.\"  No kidding, Sherlock, the rest of us have it in the bag!Besides the grammar and spelling issues, there is the stupid and awkward writing:  For years he worked on his accent so that it didn't have a trace of idiomatic slant clouding his otherwise smooth speech.  Or: Taj looked at her big limped brown eyes and realized something.  She was using her sex appeal on him.  And then: \"Taj, huh?\" Harry looked at her funnily.  \"You said that too feelingly.\"  How about redundancy:  Natasha stared at Taj, taking in his curly ruffled hair that looked as if it had been ruffled... Yep, it was ruffled.  Or:  Now what was her story?  Everybody had a story and amount of relationship baggage.  She looked to be in her early twenties--no ring on her finger--very attractive.  Usually these days that meant a whole lot of baggage.  He usually stayed away from 'baggage.\"  Then there were just those WTF does she mean phrases:  The class was very near his office and he felt a twinge of regret that he had not made the effort to reach there on time.  He liked to start as he meant to go on and he did not want to have a reputation as the professor who was never on time.  Or Taj paused for awhile before he walked up to the impressive walkway.  On each stairwell was a representative of each of the four animals from Daniels vision in the Bible.  So, to be clear, the animals sent representatives?  And does the author know that a stairwell is an empty space for steps ...I'm having trouble picturing this...  Natasha ceased her sympathy like a lifeline and offered some of her own.  What?!  \"I don't mean to cut you, Mrs. Carlisle,\" Harry said butting in.  Wow! don't interrupt him when he has a knife!  My favorite:  \"Because I had five miscarriages and the doctor had to remove my womb from the last baby.\"  Baby hung on tight, I guess...This was sappy romance and ridiculous mystery.  The only ones not getting it were the detectives.  I'm a nurse, so I found the the whole potassium poison theory a farce.  Hyperkalemia is too much potassium and it's definitely not treated by giving someone more ( that would be hypokalemia.)  The  author has a doctor saying ...leads to a type of cardiac arrest known as ventricular fibrillation, just one of many types of cardiac arrest.  No, arrest means stop.  There is only one kind of cardiac arrest, in which the heart stops beating.  Ventricular fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia, or aberrant heartbeat...or, never mind.  The man who was stuck from behind and collapsed, rendering him conveniently unable to identify his attacker?  It would have to be injected directly into a vein and even then wouldn't be that immediate.  And the pathologist who was suspicious of the dead man's K levels did not look for an injection site?  Unbelievable!  But conjecture didn't stop Harry from announcing a least six times \"he did it!\" Or \"she did it.\" about all of the suspects in succession -- except the real killer.  My very generous 2 stars is for plot, which developed by a skilled writer would have made an interesting read.,   \n",
       "137515  After reading Congratulation: It should have been me I was hooked. I couldn't wait for this book to hit paperback; just had to know what happen asap, so I downloaded it on Kindle for PC. This book is just as good as the first book. I'm not going to say too many names...that will spoil both this and the first book for those who have not read them.In part two there are new character's introduced. Here we have Regina and Reginald(Reggie), Chuck and his wife(I'm not sure if they are the two from the first book or not if so I will be shocked when I find out in part three), and then there are the main character's from the first book which are; Thomas, Alicia, Tiffany, Matt and William.I was kind of at set because this book was short; I read it as soon as I was done with the first book and it only took me at least three hours with breaks in between. I must say that it is just as good as the fist book. It will have you saying, \"don't do it\" \"do it\" \"what was you thinking\" \"you dumb\" etc. What I found out about William wasn't much but it made my hurt sink. I felt/feel so bad for the out come for the other party that it makes me feel the pain that is sure to come.This book pulls you in so much that you are feeling messed up from the pain that they go through, going through or will go through, that's just how good it is.I want one of the two men wanting married women to have her. I think that they were meant for each other. For me, both married couples jumped the broom too fast. They barely knew each other and know all type of ish is about to hit the fan...and boy will be funky.For one of them; not saying that its right how it went down but I think that person deserved what happened to them. The second one, well nothing happened yet but the way it was all playing out something is bound to happen. The question is; What?................I just have to wait for part three to find out what really goes down.I went to Darrin Lowery's web page; the third book will be out this fall. When it hit Amazon I will be buying both 2 and 3.DON'T ON THIS SERIES; GET BOTH 1 AND 2 RIGHT NOW. PART THREE IS ON ITS WAY!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "467636  Note: page references are taken from an ePUB version of the book.Lady Grace Ryburn is in love with a dashing young lieutenant, Colin Barry, but she turns away, thinking that Colin is in love with her sister.Should Colin throw propriety to the winds, imitate his pirate father, and simply take what he most desires? Or will he learn that true danger lies not on the high seas, but in the mistakes that can break a heart&#8230;and ruin a life forever.This was a three part novella that has ties to other books by Eloisa James, but I read it as a standalone.I love Eloisa James' stories, but I'm way behind in my reading of her lovely books. Little by little, I'll read them all but, she's so prolific, I just don't know if I'll ever catch up.My thoughts on Part One:Grace is a shy, observant girl, a talented artist, a quiet soul. She&#8217;s always in the background outshone by her younger sister, Lily. &#8220;She watched the way grown-ups responded to a girl like Lily versus a girl like herself.&#8221; (p6)I love that the first thing Grace notices about Colin is his kindness. This is a true hero quality to me.Grace and Colin are childhood friends, whose parents are good family friends. He joins the Royal Navy, and she offers to write to him. They begin a mostly one-sided correspondence on her end, but he comes to realize her letters distract him from the horrors of battle. But she doesn&#8217;t write about being the wallflower to Lily&#8217;s belle, no matter how painful. She also includes small pictures of her art. It is crushing to see Colin notice Lily and ignore Grace, however unintentional. I could feel Grace&#8217;s pain terribly.I love the cliffhanger endings between the books. Some readers may not like this but I don&#8217;t mind waiting for good things. I&#8217;m currently waiting on the second installment of Maya Rodale&#8217;s fun Bad Boys and Wallflowers series, so patience is a good thing. For good writing and delicious stories, I will definitely wait.Though the parents of both Grace and Colin are connected to The Ugly Duchess and Seduced by a Pirate, these stories can be read on their own.Logophile&#8217;s delight: frogspawn, pennywhistle, fleshpots.Memorable moments:&#8220;But she simply could not sparkle. At at times, she felt so desperately shy that she could hardly speak.&#8221; (p31)&#8220;But Lily wasn&#8217;t complex or thoughtful, the way Grace was. She was dazzling and rather shallow, while Grace was full of mystery. A man could spend a lifetime learning all there was to learn about Grace.&#8221; (p51)My thoughts on Part Two:Grace wants a husband who can respect her as well as love her, which is why she accepts McIngle, especially when she remembers how Colin &#8220;slighted her letters.&#8221; (p6) She reminds me of Elinor to Lily&#8217;s Marianne from Jane Austen&#8217;s Sense and Sensibility.When she gives away Colin&#8217;s paints in favor of John&#8217;s, she accepts what is, instead of what she dearly wishes for.When Colin returns, he decides that he must keep away from Grace because he doesn&#8217;t wish to be a burden. Just like a man.It is a great moment when Grace determines to tell Colin how she feels and admits as much to her mother. Her mother, while surprised, is admiring and supportive as well.Memorable moments:&#8220;It was amazing how he could calmly admit a need for help and still make it so clear that he was burning with rage at the very idea.&#8221; (p14)&#8220;Tears rolled down her chess, and her mother handed her a perfectly pressed handkerchief embroidered with the Ashbrook crest.&#8221; (p22)&#8220;She tipped back her head and looked at his face. It was a strong, almost harsh face that looked as if it had been carved by sea winds.&#8221; (p48)My thoughts on Part Three:I believe this is the first wedding ceremony I&#8217;ve read in historical romance and it is beautifully and lovingly portrayed here.The scene with the horse feels a little out of place toward the end; anything hinting at animal abuse just disturbs me.A thoroughly enjoyable love story in installments.James has an enchantment quality to her writing, which brings to mind the writing styles of both Katharine Ashe and Maya Rodale, two of my favorite historical romance writers. I definitely plan to read more Eloisa James in future, including the two linked books, The Ugly Duchess and Seduced by a Pirate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "204535  *** This book was given to me for an honest review and was not purchased through Amazon***I'd have to say that I am a little torn on my rating for this book. It held my interest up until about 70% of the book. I'll start with what I liked about the book. Nora has always done what her father wanted her to do. She broke off her relationship with the first man she had ever loved because her father didn't approve of him. She later meets Liam, a man who works for her father. They soon become engaged and he starts to show his true colors. Finally standing up for herself, she leaves Liam the day before their wedding. This was the first step she took in finding her independence. I thought for sure that she would stay with him to make her father happy.Next, she decides to get away from town and go to Dreara. Some time away can give her time to think about what she really wants. She makes some new friendships and even meets a new guy named Ethan. They have both been scarred by love and aren't ready to take their friendship to the next level....yet. Ethan encourages Nora to go to cooking school. One of Nora's lifelong dreams was to learn to cook and open her own restaurant. Nora shows such tremendous growth throughout the story. I will tell you that she does eventually start a relationship with Ethan, but I will leave it at that.Now for my gripes...I can't tell you much without spoiling the story. I feel that there were too many conflicts towards the end. I understand why they were there. They were beneficial in turning the story around. I was glad that she worked things out with her father but I feel like she turned into an indecisive teenager at the end. It was a lot of back and forth and it really turned me off. I seriously wanted to throw something. The romance was a bit tame and I would have liked more of the swoon factor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "393219  I'm a huge fan of Jimmy Pudge. I love his craziness, I adore his redneck sensibility, I freak out over his freakiness. And he's got a dirty mind that just drives me wild.No, seriously, I'm talking about his writing. Pudge just keeps getting better, and when he had me thinking \"He can't top this craziness,\" darned if he didn't go right out and change everything. And I'm still loving it.Corn Bred has less of Pudge's usual nightmare-in-a-trailer-park style. Joshua, the main character, lives in a tidy little house with a sweet little fiance. He's a librarian, for goodness sake, not a porn star or a strapping serial killer who spent his life chained in a basement. He's a guy who survived a hellacious childhood at the hands of his schizophrenic father. But he has survived and made himself a happy little life.And then someone starts harassing Joshua, hurting those around him. And Joshua keeps waking up naked, bloody and with no memory of the past few hours. A trip to the psychiatrist seems to help, until Joshua's nemesis crawls out of his own head and turns Joshua's life upside down. Josh has another personality living inside of him, a personality that, if the shrink is allowed to \"cure\" Josh, will die. So it's a life and death battle and we just gotta wonder - is mild-mannered Josh able to defeat the damaged, amoral Corn Bred? Josh's own mind created Corn Bred to protect Josh from memories of his childhood terrors, but now it's a clash of wills as the two personalities fight for control of Josh's body and his life.Dont' wait for Pudge's usual belly-laughs and crazy asides. This book is all business, friends, and it's good. Pudge is stepping into a new arena of horror and he's up for the fight. This one oughta be a knockout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "376716  A Solid Read. Stevie is a man in his mid-thirties. His one obvious vice in life is a taste for young, barely legal girls. The way Stevie sees it, if a girl reaches the age of consent&#8212;age 16 in his neck of the woods&#8212;she&#8217;s fair game.When Stevie meets the young Jessie, he begins to plot and scheme to make the girl his own. However, after meeting the sixteen-year-old girl&#8217;s parents, it becomes clear they do not like the middle-aged Romeo&#8217;s intentions toward their daughter. Realizing this won&#8217;t be the easy conquest he imagined, Stevie finds solace in his former love interest Jill, who at twenty-one years of age, is too old for Stevie&#8217;s tastes.But Jessie is a stubborn girl. She refuses to allow her father final say where her budding love life is concerned. Cracks begin to appear almost immediately as the relationship begins its ascent. Damaged Girls is a well-written documentation of that which is all too commonplace in our society: One person taking advantage of another for selfish motives. Author Janice G. Ross explores the subject to its very core, bringing to light these character traits that seem to permeate the human race.Ross presents a great study of characters on both sides of this complicated fence, showing that even the victim in this isn&#8217;t really as innocent as one might think. And while the reader certainly won&#8217;t feel sorry for the predatory Stevie, the author manages to paint the man as human rather than monster. He has friends who care about him, particularly the story&#8217;s narrative voice, a woman named Morgan. But friend or not, Morgan&#8217;s goal is to protect the young girl, keeping her from the snare of Stevie&#8217;s web. But Morgan just might be too late.Damaged Girls by Janice Ross is a good, solid read; dark at ties, but quite the page-turner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "926590  I fell in love with Jus when I devoured RUINED and let me .... I fell in love with Jus when I devoured RUINED and let me tell you&#8230;I fell in love all over again with RULES OF SURVIVAL. She has a way of enthralling readers. She keeps them captivated with her story lines and riveting characters.RULES OF SURVIVAL was full of drama and mystery. I couldn&#8217;t put this book down because I just had to know what happened next. It kept me on the edge of my seat with its action-packed scenes. It seemed like when Mikayla and Shaun found one piece to the ever growing puzzle it brought up more and more questions surrounding Mikayla&#8217;s, um, predicament. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything for ya&#8217;ll, but wow&#8230;Mikayla has been through the ringer and her world has been one big pot of craziness since her mother&#8217;r murder. Shaun has his own set of demons so together they are hilariously perfect for one another even if they are on different sides of this cat-mouse game.Mikayla&#8217;s character was likable. She has a witty personality mixed with loads of sarcasm so she&#8217;s pretty perfect in my book. Shaun is freakin&#8217; sex on legs and his mysterious bounty hunter persona only adds to his sexiness. Both characters, actually every character, in this book were well-developed. The plot is well paced and there is never a dull moment. Between the intense drama scenes and the chemistry between Mikayla and Shaun readers are brought into a whirl-wind of a story. Watching the story play out was pretty awesome. I loved watching Mikayla and Shaun work to figure out the mess her mother left. I loved watching the relationship develop between the main characters. Basically, I loved everything about this book.It was calculating, mysterious, and at times down right funny. Jus Accardo&#8217;s writing style is very unique and so far I have loved everything I have read by her. I look forward to many more amazing stories by Jus Accardo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Each has a link to the missing children and some links are more sinister than others.Very Intriguing Novel!**Review copy courtesy of Original Publisher CHBB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "256627  Heartbreaking!. ***Contains spoilers if you have not read Throne of Glass*****This occurs right before Celaena is captured and sent to the mines.Celaena and Sam want to escape the city and leave the Guild of Assassins with the blessing of Arobynn. But the price Arobynn wants for them will almost clean Celaena out and he knows it. Still she believes it will be worth it if she and Sam can be free to live somewhere else without having to look over their shoulders for an assassin sent by the Guild.This is the story of Celaena and Sam, how they love each other, how patient Sam is with her, how she's so afraid to lose control even with him, but she trusts him more than anything in the world. Arobynn tries to undermine Sam's undeniable trust in Celaena by hinting at her past when her parents died, some secret that scares her more than anything, but Sam tells her she'll tell him when she's ready. He actually has more faith in her than she does in herself.Sam wants to do one more job, one big one to get some money so they'll be set when they leave. They won't have to worry about money after this since Celaena paying Arobynn pretty much wiped them out. So, against her gut and wishes, they take the job. And it's their undoing. They are betrayed. It leaves Celaena on her way to the mines and Sam, her beloved Sam who she wanted to spend the rest of her life with, dead. And her brilliant mind way too much time to consider who it was that betrayed them. We as the readers are let in on the secret, but I believe Celaena is thinking along the wrong lines.I can't wait to find out what happens when she finds out who betrayed her! I hope she guts him like a fish! I definitely recommend this story, but think it's better read after Throne of Glass. Celaena comes across as a bit spoiled in this and I think we see the real Celaena in Throne of Glass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "285535  HOT Read. A small town, the town's golden boy, and a girl from the wrong side of the tracks, can only amount to trouble especially when love is involved.Zuri's middle name should have be trouble. From early on, people misunderstood her and judged her by the actions of her stepfather. They thought she was trouble and either kept their distance while whispering bad things about her behind her back or boys only wanted to get in her pants because they thought she was easy. She was a loner, but not by choice. Except there was one cowboy who refused to leave her alone even after she refused him. After finally giving in to his charms, Zuri started realizing that with him is where she belonged, but she was unsure if he felt the same. On a day that should have otherwise been a happy one for a couple of teenagers in love, Zuri finally receives the answer she'd been waiting for. Now it's been twelve years since she last saw Colt Triplehorn, but their reunion may be too little too late.Colt's future changed dramatically the day Zuri walked out of his life. The hopeful young man he was grew up into the hardened sheriff he is now. Although he hasn't seen her in a long time, Zuri still influences his life. From his mood right down to his sex life, or lack thereof, and even his brothers have taken notice. It's Colt's job to maintain order in the small town of Caldera and work the family ranch, but there's something missing in his orderly life. That something appears one-day butt naked and bringing a whirlwind of trouble with her except this time, they are playing by Colt's rules. Too many misunderstandings and hurt feelings still stand in the way, but their physical attraction and chemistry is undeniable. Colt will get his answers and Zuri will get hers, but at what cost when a robbery, a stalker, and mistrust all stand in the way?This first in The TripleHorn Brand series, is fun, fast paced, and full of cowboy goodness! It was great to read the heroine taking the troublemaking lead in the story and give the hero a run for his money in getting her out of it. I figured that with how Zuri grew up she would be a bit harder and much more independent especially when it came to her reunion with Colt, maybe even make him work for it a little more, but that just wasn't the case. They both have things to atone for in their relationship, but Zuri almost immediately hands over control to him and that I just couldn't connect with. The history on their individual backgrounds and relationship is somewhat sparse, but eventually came together by the end. I was looking forward to reading more about Colt's brothers, but not much is given on them, which of course has me searching out the next in the series.Although each of the scenes ended somewhat abruptly, the story kept right on progressing and made it engaging to read. The sex scenes are plentiful and vital to the emotional growth of the couple, but also extremely steamy and well worth the read. I would definitely recommend this to fans of alpha male cowboys with big appetites in and out of the bedroom!Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "23539   Time to Kill. Mindy McLaurin is in jail on embezzlement charges.  Coming from her background, she is totally out of her element.  She claims her innocence as do most inmates, but the only one to believe her is Counselor Stone.Prior to Mindy's incarceration, Alexis died suspiciously while in jail.  Her mother, Gwen, is having her death investigated.  While in jail, Mindy's  `cellie' is murdered.  Mindy has her suspicions, but can't prove anything.The inmate protagonists, especially Red, Deputy Delacy and Major, make for a real-to-life prison setting.  Having read books on real jailhouse environments, K. Dawn Byrd, in Killing Time,  has set the stage for some very real, intriguing, and unsettling times for Mindy.  You are kept `on edge,' rooting for her safety throughout her incarceration.Once she is bailed out, you think everything will be settled in due time.  That's when K. Dawn Byrd ups the ante on the suspense.  If Mindy thought life was hard in jail, it becomes a nightmare out of jail.  The plots and twists are even more eerie and threatening.I loved the romance that built up from the first interaction between Mindy and Counselor Stone.  It was a sweet, yet believable, relationship that developed over time.  But would it last?  Mindy was having difficulties about whom she could trust?To punctuate the story with delight, Zippy, Mindy's Chinese Crested dog was introduced.  I think he added to the story as much as the characters!  What energy and spice!  Makes me want one!The title of the book has a double connotation to it-Killing Time.  A very creative title for a very creative story!  Although this is my first book by K. Dawn Byrd, it won't be my last!  A definite 4.5 out of 5.0!This e-book was provided by K. Dawn Byrd in exchange for my honest review.  No monetary compensation was exchanged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "874920  I'm excited to start book two, to know what's next and what would Jocelyn do. I love to read about Jocelyn and Jackson.. I'm excited to start book two, to know what's next and what would Jocelyn do. I love to read about Jocelyn and Jackson, about their friends and family. They have become dear to me. I would love to have something deep and powerful like their love myself. I like to read how Jocelyn deals with challenges coming her way. I find her feelings understandable and close to my own. I'm wondering where her choices would take her, what would I do, what choices would I make if I was in here place and in here circumstances, what would I feel having a chance to see my life from the future. I'm wondering what implications are going to be of her actions. And what so bad could happen? I wonder whether problems would be solved in this book or they would go to the next. And again cover is amazing. I'm excited to see what others would look like.I would say it's emotionally powerful book. There were moments when it made me think about various things in life. It explored feelings of getting in the situation when your life changes a lot. It shows how individuals behave in a sight of challenging life situations, how you can see a person behaving in a way you would not have seen that coming. It tells about the problems we have, how small they are and how big they seem to be. How soon things can get complicated and we can loose the most important things in our lifes. It makes me ask what guides our decisions. It makes me wonder how much of our problems are made up by ourselves and how much is real. And what maybe we create by ourselves these problems.I guess I would feel much the same as past Jocelyn looking to the future and future Jocelyn looking to the past. Living today I don't think about how much times have changed and how much situation has changed for women. I just don't give it a thought, take it for granted and don't consider how I would feel if I couldn't have it all. This story made me think how much life has changed and to cherish things we have. As Jocelyn said &#34;all the stuff that I take for granted everyday and think nothing of&#34;. It brings interest in me to know what social changes have happened, when and why. I know history but not that much how the social life and values have changed, when and why. Also it gives me a thought how much of emotions are behind the facts of history, eg. war, woman freedom. In here there is an opportunity to take a deeper look in differences between two eras and ask myself all these questions.Now as this story has ended I want more and I'm waiting to see what's next.I have received this book free from the David Estes Fans and YA Book Lovers Unite! group and the author in exchange for a honest review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

I have about 3-1/2 months of this Protection Plan left on it yet. I have NOT had to use this so far, but I have the 'peace of mind', knowing if I 'do' need to use it, it IS THERE!This is how it works: You 'MUST' buy it when you purchase the Kindle item of your choice. There is NO GOING BACK TO PURCHASE IT! It is a 'now or never' product to purchase at the time of ANY Kindle product purchase.So I originally purchased this item the first time,- the 2nd Year Extended Warranty, at the time I purchased my first Kindle, as stated above, a little more than 1-1/2 years ago. So far I have NOT needed to use it. I am very careful' when I use my Kindle.This is how 'this' product works: The FIRST YEAR you own your Kindle (of ANY type) it is automatically covered by a 1 year warranty through Kindle. After that 1st year of automatic coverage, there is zero warranty left.Now is when 'this product' kicks in! This 2 Year Protection Plan covers the 2nd Year of owning your Kindle.(Not the 1st year.) This gives you an extended 1 FULL '2nd YEAR' of warranty time.You never know what 'could' happen, so by having this, even if it is only for peace-of-mind, you've got it! I look at it as a kind of insurance for the Kindle. I feel safe and secure knowing I have a second year of warranty time on my Kindle for the first 2 years of my ownership on ANY TYPE OF KINDLE ITEM in case anything happens to it along the way as I use it.I have just purchased the Kindle FIRE HD 8.9&#34;! I can't WAIT to get it!Yes, I purchased THIS PRODUCT WHEN I PURCHASED THE FIRE! Remember - this product MUST BE PURCHASED WHEN YOU PURCHASE 'ANY' KINDLE PRODUCT 'at the same time you purchase your Kindle (of any type)!' PLEASE remember this!You should be VERY happy with it!'The prices 'do' vary, depending on the type of Kindle item you purchase. This only makes sense, as the more expensive the Kindle, the more expensive the warranty will be. Regardless, the price of this Protection Plan has far exceeded my expectations!Additional thoughts: When we purchase ANY Kindle item, the costs add up for ALL the accessories we purchase for it, and it adds up  quickly! Not only are we purchasing the Kindle item, but ALL the other accessories that go with it, so if ANYTHING happens to your Kindle, you WANT IT REPLACED! This allows you to do so! So, to have this 2nd year Protection Plan is well-worth EVERY PENNY! It's a must-NEED item to go along with your Kindle! No matter what Kindle item it is, you are protecting!Thankfully, I have NOT had to use this so far, but still have about 3 months left on it. Hopefully I won't have to use it, but I feel safe and secure just knowing I DO have it for that 'just in case'!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "629288  I couldn't put it down. I didn't read this book until it was recommended to me by a friend who said she couldn't put it down. I read the synopsis and I thought to myself, &#8220;This sounds good,&#8221; but I didn't realise just how great it was until chapter 4. Chapters 1 to 3 were good BUT, from chapter 4, I was well and truly hooked.I loved Lexi from the beginning, probably because she was the woman I wish I was when I was younger, but as I got to &#8216;know&#8217; her more and realised that she had so many layers, I LOVED her. Because I didn't read &#8220;About the Author&#8221; until after I had finished the book, I wasn't aware that her goal was to write a book with a strong female character. Well, I definitely think she achieved that goal.Although this was Lexi&#8217;s story, I also loved all the other characters (except Marcy). They all had an integral part to play in the book and not one character was superfluous. How could I not love Alex? I was pleased when I found out that the person I pictured for Alex was also the author&#8217;s muse, but that&#8217;s probably because the author&#8217;s portrayal of characters and her writing were so good.But Alex wasn't the only other character that I fell in love with. There was Matt and James and Kate and Hannah and Mike. Yes, there were more, but the best thing was how each character played an important part in Lexi&#8217;s life and each other&#8217;s.Even though I've mentioned the characters a lot, they were not the only strength of this book. I've already mentioned the connections between the characters, but the events were also connected and the whole story flowed seamlessly. I even found the chapter headings to be entertaining.When I said that I didn't realise how great it was until chapter 4, I forgot to say that it kept getting better and better from that point on. At no time, did I feel that the story was stagnating and not moving on. Like its characters, every event that occurred had a place in the story.  I'm also very happy that I can start reading the next one &#8220;A Leap of Faith&#8221; straight away because I don&#8217;t want to wait. BTW, A Twist of Fate doesn't end with a cliff hanger.This was a book I could NOT put down willingly. I gave A Twist of Fate 5 out of 5 stars.Written by Karen from Confessions of a Bookaholic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "318189  Sexy and funny but surprisingly with depth and characters.. I don't make it a secret that I do read these type of books out of boredom. But this is from another author recommendation and I do find that its well written for a sort-of trashy romance novel. The novel began much like any ordinary Harlequin-setting island paradise with a female character and her obnoxious friend and suddenly there's a big hurricane incoming towards them and the main character inexplicably trapped in the hotel's elevator with a guy and they're stranded on the island for several days and spent being together and romancing until they're saved and she realized that the guy who saved her life is a billionaire - and she ran away.You read that right. That is the start of a good relationship I had with this series. Bronte is an entertaining character to read about. Weirdly funny, spunky, stubborn, smart, don't take any nonsense and very independant and very flawed and prideful, random and frankly quotable. She's a waitress having a hard time finding a permanent job even when she had a degree (some predicament I could relate to) and have a hive mind with greek philosopher and quotes random dead author's phrases that baffled and entice Logan. But one of the things she have a hard time accepting, people who lied to her. That's what essentially Logan did to her when he omitted out that he own the island wreckage  and also several jet planes which made the book entirely unpredictable and interesting to say the least. He end up buying the diner where she work just to ask her to spend the time with him in New York. Thats the fantasy everyone love right? But then Bronte became increasingly annoyed with Logan and the way everyone treated her as if she's replaceable and she hated it when Logan shower her gifts and then she literally blew up. Yep, loads of groveling in coming.As a contemporary romance, Bronte is a very likable character. Logan aren't that bad himself but he does seem like an average guy underneath his bluster. The book started like an average pulp but then end up being very enjoyable to the end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "560971  hilarious... ..except this is not supposed to be a comedy?  I won't even mention all the editing issues, as they have been well outlined by other reviewers.  They are not the only thing wrong with this novel.  I should have been suspicious of all the one line five star reviews with nothing substantive to say.Harry and Natasha are supposedly the best, most sought after detectives in this whole Jamaican police department department because they get results.  I hate to think of the worst because these two are dumb as posts.  They are sent undercover to investigate a murder of the president of a Christian college.Two of the first characters to be introduced are Taj Jackson, recruited for a new psychiatric dept. as well as potentially new president.  Another is Anne Carter, who Natasha knows from her church at home.  Taj knows he is adopted.  At least 6 people remark about his uncanny resemblance to the acting president, Ryan Bancroft.  Anne has remarkably curly hair, which is exactly like Taj's.  Natasha knows that Anne grew up in a poor family with many children whose fisherman father was lost at sea.  Then, when investigating the details of Taj's adoption, it is discovered that he was given up by a young pregnant girl with extremely curly hair who came from a family with many children; and yes, her fisherman father was lost at sea.  And yes, they discover that the Bancroft family used to live there as well, approximately the time when Taj was born.  At one point, the author writes: Harry rubbed his ears.  He always did that when he was close to some important piece of information and could not figure it out.  At about sixty percent through the book I literally laughed out loud when I read ...Natasha said, \"I'm missing something.  Something vital.\"  No kidding, Sherlock, the rest of us have it in the bag!Besides the grammar and spelling issues, there is the stupid and awkward writing:  For years he worked on his accent so that it didn't have a trace of idiomatic slant clouding his otherwise smooth speech.  Or: Taj looked at her big limped brown eyes and realized something.  She was using her sex appeal on him.  And then: \"Taj, huh?\" Harry looked at her funnily.  \"You said that too feelingly.\"  How about redundancy:  Natasha stared at Taj, taking in his curly ruffled hair that looked as if it had been ruffled... Yep, it was ruffled.  Or:  Now what was her story?  Everybody had a story and amount of relationship baggage.  She looked to be in her early twenties--no ring on her finger--very attractive.  Usually these days that meant a whole lot of baggage.  He usually stayed away from 'baggage.\"  Then there were just those WTF does she mean phrases:  The class was very near his office and he felt a twinge of regret that he had not made the effort to reach there on time.  He liked to start as he meant to go on and he did not want to have a reputation as the professor who was never on time.  Or Taj paused for awhile before he walked up to the impressive walkway.  On each stairwell was a representative of each of the four animals from Daniels vision in the Bible.  So, to be clear, the animals sent representatives?  And does the author know that a stairwell is an empty space for steps ...I'm having trouble picturing this...  Natasha ceased her sympathy like a lifeline and offered some of her own.  What?!  \"I don't mean to cut you, Mrs. Carlisle,\" Harry said butting in.  Wow! don't interrupt him when he has a knife!  My favorite:  \"Because I had five miscarriages and the doctor had to remove my womb from the last baby.\"  Baby hung on tight, I guess...This was sappy romance and ridiculous mystery.  The only ones not getting it were the detectives.  I'm a nurse, so I found the the whole potassium poison theory a farce.  Hyperkalemia is too much potassium and it's definitely not treated by giving someone more ( that would be hypokalemia.)  The  author has a doctor saying ...leads to a type of cardiac arrest known as ventricular fibrillation, just one of many types of cardiac arrest.  No, arrest means stop.  There is only one kind of cardiac arrest, in which the heart stops beating.  Ventricular fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia, or aberrant heartbeat...or, never mind.  The man who was stuck from behind and collapsed, rendering him conveniently unable to identify his attacker?  It would have to be injected directly into a vein and even then wouldn't be that immediate.  And the pathologist who was suspicious of the dead man's K levels did not look for an injection site?  Unbelievable!  But conjecture didn't stop Harry from announcing a least six times \"he did it!\" Or \"she did it.\" about all of the suspects in succession -- except the real killer.  My very generous 2 stars is for plot, which developed by a skilled writer would have made an interesting read.,   \n",
       "137515  A MUST READ!!!. After reading Congratulation: It should have been me I was hooked. I couldn't wait for this book to hit paperback; just had to know what happen asap, so I downloaded it on Kindle for PC. This book is just as good as the first book. I'm not going to say too many names...that will spoil both this and the first book for those who have not read them.In part two there are new character's introduced. Here we have Regina and Reginald(Reggie), Chuck and his wife(I'm not sure if they are the two from the first book or not if so I will be shocked when I find out in part three), and then there are the main character's from the first book which are; Thomas, Alicia, Tiffany, Matt and William.I was kind of at set because this book was short; I read it as soon as I was done with the first book and it only took me at least three hours with breaks in between. I must say that it is just as good as the fist book. It will have you saying, \"don't do it\" \"do it\" \"what was you thinking\" \"you dumb\" etc. What I found out about William wasn't much but it made my hurt sink. I felt/feel so bad for the out come for the other party that it makes me feel the pain that is sure to come.This book pulls you in so much that you are feeling messed up from the pain that they go through, going through or will go through, that's just how good it is.I want one of the two men wanting married women to have her. I think that they were meant for each other. For me, both married couples jumped the broom too fast. They barely knew each other and know all type of ish is about to hit the fan...and boy will be funky.For one of them; not saying that its right how it went down but I think that person deserved what happened to them. The second one, well nothing happened yet but the way it was all playing out something is bound to happen. The question is; What?................I just have to wait for part three to find out what really goes down.I went to Darrin Lowery's web page; the third book will be out this fall. When it hit Amazon I will be buying both 2 and 3.DON'T ON THIS SERIES; GET BOTH 1 AND 2 RIGHT NOW. PART THREE IS ON ITS WAY!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "467636  With This Kiss by Eloisa James. Note: page references are taken from an ePUB version of the book.Lady Grace Ryburn is in love with a dashing young lieutenant, Colin Barry, but she turns away, thinking that Colin is in love with her sister.Should Colin throw propriety to the winds, imitate his pirate father, and simply take what he most desires? Or will he learn that true danger lies not on the high seas, but in the mistakes that can break a heart&#8230;and ruin a life forever.This was a three part novella that has ties to other books by Eloisa James, but I read it as a standalone.I love Eloisa James' stories, but I'm way behind in my reading of her lovely books. Little by little, I'll read them all but, she's so prolific, I just don't know if I'll ever catch up.My thoughts on Part One:Grace is a shy, observant girl, a talented artist, a quiet soul. She&#8217;s always in the background outshone by her younger sister, Lily. &#8220;She watched the way grown-ups responded to a girl like Lily versus a girl like herself.&#8221; (p6)I love that the first thing Grace notices about Colin is his kindness. This is a true hero quality to me.Grace and Colin are childhood friends, whose parents are good family friends. He joins the Royal Navy, and she offers to write to him. They begin a mostly one-sided correspondence on her end, but he comes to realize her letters distract him from the horrors of battle. But she doesn&#8217;t write about being the wallflower to Lily&#8217;s belle, no matter how painful. She also includes small pictures of her art. It is crushing to see Colin notice Lily and ignore Grace, however unintentional. I could feel Grace&#8217;s pain terribly.I love the cliffhanger endings between the books. Some readers may not like this but I don&#8217;t mind waiting for good things. I&#8217;m currently waiting on the second installment of Maya Rodale&#8217;s fun Bad Boys and Wallflowers series, so patience is a good thing. For good writing and delicious stories, I will definitely wait.Though the parents of both Grace and Colin are connected to The Ugly Duchess and Seduced by a Pirate, these stories can be read on their own.Logophile&#8217;s delight: frogspawn, pennywhistle, fleshpots.Memorable moments:&#8220;But she simply could not sparkle. At at times, she felt so desperately shy that she could hardly speak.&#8221; (p31)&#8220;But Lily wasn&#8217;t complex or thoughtful, the way Grace was. She was dazzling and rather shallow, while Grace was full of mystery. A man could spend a lifetime learning all there was to learn about Grace.&#8221; (p51)My thoughts on Part Two:Grace wants a husband who can respect her as well as love her, which is why she accepts McIngle, especially when she remembers how Colin &#8220;slighted her letters.&#8221; (p6) She reminds me of Elinor to Lily&#8217;s Marianne from Jane Austen&#8217;s Sense and Sensibility.When she gives away Colin&#8217;s paints in favor of John&#8217;s, she accepts what is, instead of what she dearly wishes for.When Colin returns, he decides that he must keep away from Grace because he doesn&#8217;t wish to be a burden. Just like a man.It is a great moment when Grace determines to tell Colin how she feels and admits as much to her mother. Her mother, while surprised, is admiring and supportive as well.Memorable moments:&#8220;It was amazing how he could calmly admit a need for help and still make it so clear that he was burning with rage at the very idea.&#8221; (p14)&#8220;Tears rolled down her chess, and her mother handed her a perfectly pressed handkerchief embroidered with the Ashbrook crest.&#8221; (p22)&#8220;She tipped back her head and looked at his face. It was a strong, almost harsh face that looked as if it had been carved by sea winds.&#8221; (p48)My thoughts on Part Three:I believe this is the first wedding ceremony I&#8217;ve read in historical romance and it is beautifully and lovingly portrayed here.The scene with the horse feels a little out of place toward the end; anything hinting at animal abuse just disturbs me.A thoroughly enjoyable love story in installments.James has an enchantment quality to her writing, which brings to mind the writing styles of both Katharine Ashe and Maya Rodale, two of my favorite historical romance writers. I definitely plan to read more Eloisa James in future, including the two linked books, The Ugly Duchess and Seduced by a Pirate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "204535  Good story. *** This book was given to me for an honest review and was not purchased through Amazon***I'd have to say that I am a little torn on my rating for this book. It held my interest up until about 70% of the book. I'll start with what I liked about the book. Nora has always done what her father wanted her to do. She broke off her relationship with the first man she had ever loved because her father didn't approve of him. She later meets Liam, a man who works for her father. They soon become engaged and he starts to show his true colors. Finally standing up for herself, she leaves Liam the day before their wedding. This was the first step she took in finding her independence. I thought for sure that she would stay with him to make her father happy.Next, she decides to get away from town and go to Dreara. Some time away can give her time to think about what she really wants. She makes some new friendships and even meets a new guy named Ethan. They have both been scarred by love and aren't ready to take their friendship to the next level....yet. Ethan encourages Nora to go to cooking school. One of Nora's lifelong dreams was to learn to cook and open her own restaurant. Nora shows such tremendous growth throughout the story. I will tell you that she does eventually start a relationship with Ethan, but I will leave it at that.Now for my gripes...I can't tell you much without spoiling the story. I feel that there were too many conflicts towards the end. I understand why they were there. They were beneficial in turning the story around. I was glad that she worked things out with her father but I feel like she turned into an indecisive teenager at the end. It was a lot of back and forth and it really turned me off. I seriously wanted to throw something. The romance was a bit tame and I would have liked more of the swoon factor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "393219  Corn Bred takes Jimmy Pudge in new direction. I'm a huge fan of Jimmy Pudge. I love his craziness, I adore his redneck sensibility, I freak out over his freakiness. And he's got a dirty mind that just drives me wild.No, seriously, I'm talking about his writing. Pudge just keeps getting better, and when he had me thinking \"He can't top this craziness,\" darned if he didn't go right out and change everything. And I'm still loving it.Corn Bred has less of Pudge's usual nightmare-in-a-trailer-park style. Joshua, the main character, lives in a tidy little house with a sweet little fiance. He's a librarian, for goodness sake, not a porn star or a strapping serial killer who spent his life chained in a basement. He's a guy who survived a hellacious childhood at the hands of his schizophrenic father. But he has survived and made himself a happy little life.And then someone starts harassing Joshua, hurting those around him. And Joshua keeps waking up naked, bloody and with no memory of the past few hours. A trip to the psychiatrist seems to help, until Joshua's nemesis crawls out of his own head and turns Joshua's life upside down. Josh has another personality living inside of him, a personality that, if the shrink is allowed to \"cure\" Josh, will die. So it's a life and death battle and we just gotta wonder - is mild-mannered Josh able to defeat the damaged, amoral Corn Bred? Josh's own mind created Corn Bred to protect Josh from memories of his childhood terrors, but now it's a clash of wills as the two personalities fight for control of Josh's body and his life.Dont' wait for Pudge's usual belly-laughs and crazy asides. This book is all business, friends, and it's good. Pudge is stepping into a new arena of horror and he's up for the fight. This one oughta be a knockout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Prior to training the classification models we will train a MNB as a baseline without any hyper-parameter tunning. Note that the data split is stratified to preseve the class distribution in the resulting splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature set \n",
    "Due to memory constraints on my local machine (16 GB) and the relatively big dataset size, and based on the analysis above, we will only work on a trimmed version of the reviewes by extracting the first and last 64 words of each review to reduce the memory usage. Also neither SKlearn's CounterVectorizer nor TFIDFVectorizers would work, thus I have used a Hashing vectorizer which reduces the memory consumption significantly but doesn't allow the exclusion of some of the words that are too rare (small document frequency) or too common (big document frequency) as in the TFIDF. Yet we will attempt to use L1 regulariztion on LR to train our model in excluding the count of the words that are deemed insignificant by the classifier during training. \n",

The macro f1-score is choosen since it gives each class an equal weight, regardless of the number of samples it has in the dataset. `macro` averaging is usually used when each class is weighted equal based on the problem domain and the use-case, and since I am assuming equal importance to each class, this is the metric I have opted for.\n",

    "### Logistic Regression \n",
    "To handle class imbalance in the LR classifier, the class_weight parameter is used to balance out the classes by adjusting the weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data. Also an L1 regularization is used to eliminate the irrelevant words for the classification tasks in our sparse input features. An one vs rest classifier is trained for each class and a hyper-parameter tunning is ran on the `C` parameter of the regularization strength. \n",
